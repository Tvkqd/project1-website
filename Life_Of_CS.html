    <p class="panel">

    <button class="accordion">> Friends</button>

      <p class="panel">
      Friends are great, but when you have mountans of HomeWrok it can feel like you don't have time. I like to work on projects with a few friends.  When working on solo projcts they
      can help by trying to break you code. 
        <br><br>

        <br><br>
      But also rember to take some time to hangout with friend without the homewrok some times too.
