Life of a CS Major</h1>

    <p class="text">  
      The daily life of a CS major is filled with the sensation of seeing something you worked hard on finally work. 
      It can also be quite busy as CS majors will have a lot of big projects, so if you want to get ahead of the game, 
      <strong><i><u><a class = "menu" href="Prepare.html">click here to see how to prepare for a degree in Computer Science</a></u></i></strong>. <br><br>
      Though it may be busy, there is still plenty of fun to be had along the way. 
      In the end, there is nothing quite like the feeling you got when all the little pieces come together 
      to make the whole thing work.
    </p>

    <button class="accordion">> Homework</button>

    <p class="panel">
      Not going to lie there will be a lot of homework, but grab a nice drink (caffeine not required but recommended) 
      and your laptop and you can get it done in no time. It's really not too bad.

      And remember, "When the debugging gets tough the tough get rubber ducks".

    </p>
  

    <button class="accordion">> Friends</button>

      <p class="panel">
      Friends are great, but when you have mountains of homework, it can feel like you don't have time. 
      I personally like to work on projects with a few friends.  When working on solo projects, they
      can help by trying to break you code and give you yet another bug to fix. 
        <br><br>

        <br><br>
      Just remember to take some time to hangout with friends without the homework sometimes too. You will not work as well if you are 
      always stressed out.
      <br><br>
      </p>
    
    <button class="accordion">> Opportunities Outside of the Classroom</button>

    <p class="panel">
      There is a lot to be gained from being a CS student beyond just learning how to write code. For starters, you can join your campus 
      <strong><i><u><a href="https://www.acm.org/"> ACM Chapter</a></u></i></strong>
      For example, <strong><i><u><a href="https://www.oc.edu">OC's ACM</a></u></i></strong> chapter is called 
        <strong><u><i><a href="https://ocbitclub.com/" >BIT club</a></i></u></strong>. ACM is not the only option for activities 
        outside of the classroom of course. Any of them offer a chance to meet new people or get leadership experience. I would say
        it's definitely worth getting involved in at least one one campus organization that interests
       you.
