          Computer Scientists solve problems using technology. Our daily life nowaday is surrounded almost
          by computers, from the phone in your pocket to the car that you drive everyday, from the wifi at home to
          the network system at workplace, from the traffic light on the road to credit machines at the stores. 
          <br><br>
          Computer Scientists are there to solve the puzzels and make life become more convenient.

      The FitnessGramâ„¢ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start.">Contact Us!</a>
