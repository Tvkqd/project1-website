    <button class="accordion">> Job Security</button>

    <p class="panel">
      The field of Computer Science is one that has had a ton of growth.
      This means that almost every company has a use for a Computer Scientist, and by extension, there are tons of jobs.
      Not to mention that there aren't enough Computer Scientists around, so the pay is higher than most other jobs within said company of the same level.

    <button class="accordion">> Other Factors</button>

      <p class="panel">
        Pay and job security isn't everything, however. There are tons of other factors that make Computer Science a great degree to pursue.
        For example, since the demand is so high, the benefits received will likely also be bountiful.
        The job locations are also usually based in urban areas, so travel to events will be significantly shorter.

      The FitnessGramâ„¢ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start.">Contact Us!</a>
